TPF stands for Transaction Processing Facility, originally released by IBM around 1976 as ACP (Airline Control Program). TPF is a real-time mainframe operating system particularly suited to hosting large terminal networks with high transaction rates, such as with online reservation processing systems. The ability to choose different zSeries operating systems is similar to how you can select to run different operating systems on your Intel-based PC. For example, there you could run:
•Windows or Windows Enterprise Server
•Linux or Solaris or BSD or SCO UNIX
•Novell Netware Server
