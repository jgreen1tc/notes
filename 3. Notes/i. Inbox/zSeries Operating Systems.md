Operating System Software controls the Hardware 
zSeries hardware supports multiple Operating Systems
- z/OS MVS - Commercial data processing for large enterprises
- zLinux - Newly ported to run on zSeries hardware
- [[VSE]] - Used in smaller sites, limited growth
- [[TPF]] - Very large transaction processing, used for airline and hotel reservation systems, hospitals, etc.
- zVM - Virtual machine
	- Runs other operating systems (like z/OS, zLinux, or VSE) as guests
	- Highly efficient terminal driver, simpler than MVS
- ICF - Internal Coupling Facility for Parallel Sysplex (not an Operating system, but does run in a CP)
