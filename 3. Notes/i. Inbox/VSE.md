Virtual Storage Extended and was formerly known as DOS/VSE. It is a multitasking, IBM 370-architected operating system. VSE has many similarities to MVS, but runs jobs in partitions rather than address spaces, and uses POWER for input/output rather than JES. The VSE/ESA releases allowed VSE to exploit the XA-370 channel hardware architecture, 31-bit virtual and real storage support, and data spaces.
