A collection of programs that
- Manage a computer systems resources
	- Maximize device utilization
	- Transfer data between memory and devices at program request
	- Handle error detection and recovery
	- Attain maximum possible performance under current workload
- Schedules work to be done
	- Determine jobs to be run, based on job control statements
	- Assign (allocate) resources to programs as necessary
	- Handle unscheduled work such as time-sharing systems and transaction processing work
	- Communicate with operator via
		- Commands (operator to system)
		- Messages (system to operator)
- Maintain integrity of system and data
	- Provide security
	- Prevent simultaneous update
	- Prevent deadlock
- Provides an environment, a context, for application programs to run
	- Control blocks keep track of all programs in memory, their location, attributes, and status
