# Time Sharing Option
A powerful but awkward-to-use facility that allows
users at any kind of terminal to:
- Create, modify, delete, rename files
- Maintain libraries of programs, JCL, data
- Assemble, compile, link, run programs in the batch (background)or under immediate terminal control (foreground)
- Monitor status of batch jobs, examine output
- Communicate to operator or other users
